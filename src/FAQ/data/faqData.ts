    question: "How do payments work?",
    answer: "For most projects, a 50% upfront payment is required to begin development, with the remaining 50% due upon final delivery. Larger projects may have milestone-based payments. All transactions are handled securely via RazorPay, PayPal, Stripe, or direct bank transfer."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical project take?",
    answer: "Timelines depend on the project's complexity, but most websites are completed within 2–6 weeks. Game development or larger web apps can take several months. I'll always provide a clear timeline during the initial discussion."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer post-launch support?",
    answer: "Yes. Every project includes a free 14-day support window after delivery. After that, I offer optional maintenance packages for updates, bug fixes, and feature additions. I'm here to keep your project running smoothly."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I request custom features during development?",
    answer: "Absolutely. I work closely with clients through every phase. If you have new ideas or feature changes, we’ll discuss the scope and timeline adjustments if needed. Flexibility is part of the process."
